If you need to add some screenshots or other information, please do so.3. Before posting a question, make sure that you have checked previous posts so that we do not have a repeated question that has been already solved.4. We encourage you to respond unanswered questions from your classmates. Learning is a collaborative work and any additional help is appreciated.5.

Any signs of academic dishonesty will be taken VERY seriously.You are allowed to use blocks of code from Beej’s socket programming tutorial (Beej’s guide to network programming) in your project if you cite the copied part in your code.HOWEVER, copying code from friends is called plagiarism not collaboration and will result in an F for the entire course. Any libraries or pieces of code that you use and you did not write must be listed in your README file. All programs will be compared with automated tools to detect similarities; examples of code copying will get an F for the course.If you have any questions about what is or isn't allowed about plagiariam. Talk to the TA. \"I didn’t know\" is not an excuse.Hope you all enjoy the project!TAs",

(Page 22)Unfortunately, some client implementations are unable to receive such unicast IP datagrams until the implementation has been configured with a valid IP address (leading to a deadlock in which the client's IP address cannot be delivered until the client has been configured with an IP address). (Page 24)Here:giaddr:Relay agent IP address, used in booting via a relay agent.ciaddr:Client IP address; only filled in if client is in BOUND, RENEW or REBINDING state and can respond to ARP requestsyiaddr: 'your' (client) IP address.Reason for broadcast for DHCPREQUEST:The client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message that MUST include the 'server identifier' option to indicate which server it has selected, and that MAY include other options specifying desired configuration values... The servers receive the DHCPREQUEST broadcast from the client. Those servers not selected by the DHCPREQUEST message use the message as notification that the client has declined that server's offer.

My question is, couldn't we use a unicast MAC destination with a broadcast IP destination? This way other hosts on the network no longer need to process the DHCP packets. They can drop the messages as soon as they see the destination MAC doesn't match.Similarly, in ARP, the requester knows the IP but not the MAC. Can the requester use a broadcast MAC destination with a unicast IP address? This way other hosts on the network no longer need to process the ARP payload. They can drop the messages as soon as they see the destination IP doesn't match. I actually don't remember if it is indeed how ARP works. If not, why not?",
