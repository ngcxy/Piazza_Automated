If you need to add some screenshots or other information, please do so.3. Before posting a question, make sure that you have checked previous posts so that we do not have a repeated question that has been already solved.4. We encourage you to respond unanswered questions from your classmates. Learning is a collaborative work and any additional help is appreciated.5.
